# @brief:  Dictionary containing key-value pairs used by LGBoTQ. Document must use UTF-8 encoding.
#          The official YAML specification may be accessed here: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/

# 
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the following section I will try to explain the few rules this document must follow when 
# modified. If need be contact me via Discord: Roman#8312.
# 
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1   [EXAMPLE]
# When a user writes a message in any channel this bot will respond to that message if it 
# contains a certain word. For example one could write:
#   > I love pizza!
# The bot could possibly respond with:
#   > üçï!
# The way to capture this interaction is with a simple pair of 'words':
#   pizza: üçï!
# 
# The pair consists of two sides which are separated by a colon(:). Furthermore each new pair is
# followed by a line break.
# 
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2   [KEYS]
# The left word 'pizza' of that pair <pizza: üçï!> is searched for in a user-written message. In the
# following, this is referred to as a key. 
# 
# 
# 2.1 [CAPITALIZATION]
# Keys are case-insensitive, i.e. there is no difference in capitalization of the letters.
# The following words will hence produce the same response:
#   pizza
#   Pizza
#   PIZZA
#   pIzZa
# 
# 
# 2.2 [INVALID SYMBOLS]
# Keys may generally use any printable characters including numbers and special characters such
# as whitespaces. They may however not contain a newline character nor begin with either of these
# characters:
#   '['
#   ']'
#   '{'
#   '}'
#   '>'
#   '|'
#   '*'
#   '&'
#   '!'
#   '%'
#   '#'
#   '`'
#   '@'
#   ','
# 
# Or contain any of the following sequences of characters:
#   ': '
#   ' #'
#   ' -'
#
# For the purposes of the next section it is also not recommended to use keys that contain commas
# inside of a word or between words that are not separated by a whitespace. I.e. try avoiding this:
#   some,key
# 
# Instead insert a space either before and/or after the comma could look like this:
#   some, key
# 
# 
# 2.3 [MULTIPLE KEYS]
# Possible keys are either a single word, e.g. 'pizza' as seen above or they may be multiple keys.
# This is expressed as:
#   [red, green, blue]: Colorful!
# 
# If multiple keys are used they will result in a single response even if multiple keys are
# present in a message:
#   > Red doesn't complement green that well.
# Will result in:
#   > Colorful!
# 
# 
# 2.4 [UNIQUENESS]
# WHEN ADDING NEW KEYS TO THIS DOCUMENT MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO DUPLICATE KEYS, I.E. NO KEY
# IS USED MORE THAN ONCE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF A PAIR!
# 
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3   [RESPONSES]
# The right hand side 'üçï!' after the colon of the pair <pizza: üçï!> is the response by the bot.
# 
# 
# 3.1 [CAPITALIZATION]
# If the response uses text, the capitalization is important. It will be printed in Discord in the
# exact way it is written after the colon.
# 
# 
# 3.2 [MULTIPLE RESPONSES]
# Possible responses are a single word / sentence, e.g. 'Colorful!' as seen above. Or there may be
# multiple responses such as:
#   love:
#       - ‚ù§
#       - :)
# 
# A response is then chosen at random with an equal probability for each option. Again this will 
# always lead to exactly one response:
#   > I love fridays!
# May by chance results in:
#   > ‚ù§
# Or:
#   > :)
# 
# 
# 3.3 [UNIQUENESS]
# Responses do not adhere to the same constraints as keys and may be used multiple times as needed.
# In that case it may be better to group both keys together in a group as is seen in [2.3].
# 
# 
# 3.4 [IMAGES + GIFS]
# If one wants to use an image or a GIF then the response has to be a hyperlink anchored to the
# desired file. It must be hosted on any website and cannot be a local file.
# For example:
#   stick: https://tenor.com/view/stick-bug-stick-bugged-bug-dancing-bug-dancing-gif-18059923
# 
# If one wants to use a local file they first need to upload it to an image hosting site and
# reference the resulting hyperlink afterwards.
# 
# 
# 3.5 [DISCORD FORMATTING]
# Since the bot simply writes messages the response may be formatted in any way Discord allows.
# For more details see https://www.remote.tools/remote-work/discord-text-formatting.
